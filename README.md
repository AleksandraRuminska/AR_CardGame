# AR_CardGame

The aim of the project was to implement a hybrid card game created in the Unity environment using the Vuforia framework, intended for a mobile phone. The project consisted in introducing elements of augmented reality to the game played using eight cards from the physical deck of Magic: The Gathering Commander Deck Spirit Squadron observed through the lens of the camera. The elements of augmented reality included in the application include: 3D models of at least selected characters from the above-mentioned deck, animations of these characters as well as elements of combat between them.

The application assumes the existence of one player who plays against an automatic opponent. Who starts the game is randomly selected. Each character will have their own attack and defense strength. If a character with a lower defense strength than the attacker's attack strength is attacked, the character dies and the attacker wins the duel and scores points.

The models used in the game where from Unity package, open source websites or created from an image with the use of PIFuHD. The models were later on edited in Blender. The characters do not always look exactly as on the card, but they bear at least some resemblance.
